    <p>The phone service we provide are usually for businesses, for example, VoIP phones where the phone does not connect to a landline(phone cable) but connected to a Cat 5 or Cat 6
      Ethernet cable. This type of phone does not require a phone line or landline to operate, it's Voice over IP and it's POE(Power over ethernet) we service most of time. So the entire phone
      is operatable with just 1 cable.</p>
